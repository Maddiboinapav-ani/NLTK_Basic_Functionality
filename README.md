# NLTK_Basic_Functionality
This repository contains a Natural Language Processing (NLP) application built with Streamlit.  The app allows users to input text and perform various NLP tasks, including tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and generating a word cloud.

**Features**
The app provides the following NLP operations:
Tokenize: Splits the input text into individual words (tokens).
Show Stop Words: Removes common English stop words from the input text and displays the remaining tokens.
Apply Stemming: Converts a given word to its root form using the Porter Stemmer.
Generate Word Cloud: Visualizes the input text in a word cloud format, highlighting the frequency of each word.

**Libraries Used**
The application relies on the following Python libraries:
Streamlit: Used for building the interactive web application.
nltk: Provides tools for NLP, including tokenization, stemming, and stop words.
WordCloud: Generates word clouds for text visualization.
matplotlib: Displays the word cloud.
